## üì¢ Latest Announcements

### `View3d.SetSectionBox` and `View.SetCropBox` have been removed. These nodes were becoming too difficult to support due to [persistent dynamo issues with bounding boxes](https://forum.dynamobim.com/t/problem-setting-crop-boxes-and-section-boxes-in-revit-2022/70045/29).

## Current Version
Rhythm is currently built against the latest Dynamo stable build. At this time that is 2.6.0.

## Components
Rhythm consists of several sub-libraries. These are describe a bit more in detail below.
- [Rhythm Core](https://github.com/johnpierson/RhythmForDynamo/tree/master/src/RhythmCore), General methods and helpers with no reliance on Revit.
- [Rhythm Revit](https://github.com/johnpierson/RhythmForDynamo/tree/master/src/Rhythm), All the Revit nodes that work from 2019-2023
- [Rhythm UI](https://github.com/johnpierson/RhythmForDynamo/tree/master/src/RhythmUI), Revit UI Nodes.
- [Rhythm View Extension](https://github.com/johnpierson/RhythmForDynamo/tree/master/src/RhythmViewExtension), this view extension allows for the auto-annotating of Rhythm nodes and control of the run mode when the user places `Background Document` nodes.
- [Rhythm Python](https://github.com/johnpierson/RhythmForDynamo/tree/master/RhythmPython), Python code for many of the popular Rhythm  nodes. <sub><sup>if you want to hurt my feelings and not use the Rhythm package :pleading_face: </sub></sup>

## Known Issues
- Nodes that interact with background opened documents take some more consideration. This includes running Dynamo graphs that use them in manual run mode and often times closing and opening dynamo after the process is complete. The reason this happens is Dynamo has limited document switching capability and we are exploiting this with those nodes. (Included Nodes: Applications.OpenDocumentFile, Applications.CloseDocument)

## Installation
Rhythm is available through Dynamo's built-in package manager. This provides the simplest installation for most users. If you are interested in manual install, there are some fabulous resources out there describing how to build your own Dynamo package.

## Thank you!

## What is with all the removals of DYFs?!!
With Dynamo 2.0 comes a fundamental file format change that makes anything that is a DYF or DYN (the filetypes that Dynamo uses) not backward compatible. This forced me to choose between two options. Option 1: Have 2 versions of Rhythm for each major version of Dynamo, eg. ‚ÄúRhythm for Dynamo 1.x‚Äù and ‚ÄúRhythm for Dynamo 2.x‚Äù. Option2: Continue my long term goals of migrating Rhythm to be fully ‚ÄúZero Touch‚Äù c# code. I went with option 2 as it provides a more stable product and further compatibility.
